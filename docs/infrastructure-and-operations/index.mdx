# Infrastructure and operations

LLMs don't run in isolation. They need robust infrastructure behind them, from high-performance GPUs to deployment automation and comprehensive observability. A strong model and solid inference optimization determine how well your application performs. But itâ€™s your infrastructure platform and inference operation practices that determine how far you can scale and how reliably you can grow.
