# Infrastructure and operations

LLMs don't run in isolation. They need robust infrastructure behind them, from high-performance GPUs to deployment automation and comprehensive observability. A strong model and solid inference optimization determine how well your application performs. But it’s your infrastructure platform and inference operation practices that determine how far you can scale and how reliably you can grow.
