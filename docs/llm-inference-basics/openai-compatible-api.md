# OpenAI-compatible API

Once an LLM is running, you’ll need a standard way to interact with it. That’s where the OpenAI-compatible API comes in.

## What is an OpenAI-compatible API?

An OpenAI-compatible API is any API that replicates the interface, request/response schema, and authentication model of OpenAI’s original API. While OpenAI didn’t formally define this as an industry standard, their API has become the de facto interface for LLMs.

The rise of ChatGPT in late 2022 demonstrated how powerful and user-friendly this approach could be:

- The clean, well-documented API makes it easy for developers to build applications with LLMs.
- Models like `gpt-4o` are accessible through simple, consistent endpoints.

As a result, it sees rapid adoption and ecosystem growth across various industries.

## Why does compatibility matter?

While OpenAI’s APIs helped kickstart the AI application development, their widespread adoption created ecosystem lock-in. Many developer tools and frameworks now only support the OpenAI API schema. Switching models or providers often requires rewriting significant parts of your application logic.

OpenAI-compatible APIs address these challenges by providing:

- **Drop-in replacement:** Swap out OpenAI’s hosted API for your own self-hosted or open-source model, without changing your application code.
- **Seamless migration:** Move between providers or self-hosted deployments with minimal disruption.
- **Consistent integration:** Maintain compatibility with tools and frameworks that rely on the OpenAI API schema (e.g., `chat/completions`, `embeddings` endpoints).

## How to call an OpenAI-compatible API

Here’s a quick example of how easy it is to point your existing OpenAI client to a self-hosted or alternative provider’s endpoint:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Use your custom endpoint URL and API key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://your-custom-endpoint.com/v1",
    api_key="sk-your-self-hosted-api-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="your-model-name",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How can I integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message)
```

If you’re already using OpenAI’s SDKs or REST interface, you can simply redirect them to your own API endpoint.This flexibility allows you to keep control over your LLM deployment, reduce vendor lock-in, and ensure your application remains future-proof.
